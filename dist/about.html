          <h5>As of March 28, 2020</h5>
          <p>
            A young, ambitious and determined student of life, I am excited to
            take on new learning opportunities and skills! With a vision in
            front of me and experience behind me, I am always improving,
            learning and moving forward. My primary skills are in web
            development and in software development. I know markup and
            programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and C#. I work
            very closely with clients and partners to develop and deploy
            websites and applications of extraordinary quality and to exact
            specifications described by the client. I'm passionate about
            development, computers, aviation and self-development. I spend a lot
            of time reading books on how I can improve myself, become more
            productive and more polite, friendly and extroverted. At the moment,
            I run one business (TrillionComputers - A computer repair company)
            and I offer my development skills to those looking for websites or
            better ways to express and materialize their business or niche idea
            in the world of the Internet.
